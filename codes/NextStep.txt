Next Step

The process that I usually follow is as follows:
1. Get a book or some introductory text about the language.
2. Go through the book and type in all of the code, making all of it run.
3. Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes.
4. Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language.
5. Read other peopleâ€™s code in the language, and try to copy their patterns.
